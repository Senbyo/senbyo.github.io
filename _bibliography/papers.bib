    abstract = {One of the most important tests available to assess human vision is the visual field test, or perimetry. While imaging of the fundus and standard tests such as Snellen charts can assess factors such as acuity, and identify damaged parts of the retina, only the visual field test can measure the subjective field of view of perception from the patient side. We introduce a Virtual Reality (VR)-based perimetry test. A systematic test for measuring the visual field function conducted in VR. The VR-based test is precise enough to supersede the standard perimetry test carried out on either a Goldmann or Octopus test machine. Using VR allows for a more comfortable experience and opens up for further development that can potentially be used to map out other deficiencies of the visual field function. It also provides the ability to gamify the test allowing it to be carried out on children. Here we present some of the considerations and implementation details which ensure that our software has the necessary capabilities of producing correct measurements and valid results.},

    abstract = {The optical properties available for an object are most often fragmented and insufficient for photorealistic rendering of the object. We propose a procedure for digitizing a translucent object with sufficient information for predictive rendering of its appearance. Based on object material descriptions, we compute optical properties and validate or adjust this object appearance model based on comparison of simulation with spectrophotometric measurements of the bidirectional scattering-surface reflectance distribution function (BSSRDF). To ease this type of comparison, we provide an efficient simulation tool that computes the BSSRDF for a particular light-view configuration. Even with just a few configurations, the localized lighting in BSSRDF measurements is useful for assessing the appropriateness of computed or otherwise acquired optical properties. To validate an object appearance model in a more common lighting environment, we render the appearance of the obtained digital twin and assess the photorealism of our renderings through pixel-by-pixel comparison with photographs of the physical object.},
