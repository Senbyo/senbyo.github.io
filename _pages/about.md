I currently work as a team lead at <a href='https://www.dalux.com/'>Dalux</a> where I oversee the development of our inhouse Vulkan-based mobile render engine. I am an external lecturere at the <a href='https://www.dtu.dk/english/'>Technical University of Denmark</a>, teaching a course about creating XR-based experiences. I am also co-founder of <a href='https://al-eye.com/'>AL-EYE</a>, where we develop software that turns mixed reality headsets with eye tracking into disability aids for people with low vision, hearing loss, or motor disability with the goal of creating a ‘universal disability aids’ that provide multisensory support individualised for each user. My passion and research interests are exploring computer graphics in the context of extended reality to create more immersive and convincing extended reality experiences.

I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Graphics by doing research that pushes graphics hardware to create high performance Virtual Reality-based visualization of scientific data. Through out my research I have developed a bespoke Vulkan-based 3D engines for VR-based visualization, I am developing a course on XR experiences, and have supervised various Graphics related projects. I have a background as a Technical Artist and Pipeline Engineer in the games and VFX industry before obtaining a MSc in Engineering.
