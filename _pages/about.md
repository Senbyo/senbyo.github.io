I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Technical University of Denmark. My research is within computer graphics and Extended Reality. I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Graphics by doing research that pushes graphics hardware to create high performance Virtual Reality-based visualization of scientific data. Through out my research I have developed a bespoke Vulkan-based 3D engines for VR-based visualization, I am developing a course on XR experiences, and have supervised various Graphics related projects. I have a background as a Technical Artist and Pipeline Engineer in the games and VFX industry before obtaining a MSc in Engineering.
