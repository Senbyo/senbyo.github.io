I am an Assistant professor at the <a href='https://www.dtu.dk/english/'>Technical University of Denmark</a>.
My research focuses on the emerging field of Perception Engineering, utilizing Extended Reality Technologies to model, understand, and explore human perception and cognition. An inter-disciplinary field requiring the collaboration between many fields from engineering to cognitive sciences. I bring to this field an expertiece in real-time computer graphics gained from more than 10 years of experience, and a passion for creating more immersive and convincing extended reality experiences.

I am also a co-founder of <a href='https://al-eye.com/'>AL-EYE</a>, where we develop software that turns mixed reality headsets with eye tracking into disability aids for people with low vision, hearing loss, or motor disability with the goal of creating a ‘universal disability aids’ that provide multisensory support individualised for each user. My passion and research interests are exploring computer graphics in the context of extended reality to create more immersive and convincing extended reality experiences.

I previously worked as a team lead at <a href='https://www.dalux.com/'>Dalux</a> where I oversaw the development of their inhouse Vulkan-based mobile render engine, and I was an external lecturere at the Technical University of Denmark, teaching a course about creating XR-based experiences. 

I obtained a Ph.D. in Computer Graphics by doing research that pushes graphics hardware to create high performance Virtual Reality-based visualization of scientific data. Through out my research I have developed a bespoke Vulkan-based 3D engines for VR-based visualization, I am developing a course on XR experiences, and have supervised various Graphics related projects. I have a background as a Technical Artist and Pipeline Engineer in the games and VFX industry before obtaining a MSc in Engineering.
